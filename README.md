I wanted to practice making a driver for a AltIMU-10 v5 Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, and Altimeter (LSM6DS33, LIS3MDL, and LPS25H Carrier)[https://www.pololu.com/product/2739/resources]. I used the official LSM303 Library [https://github.com/pololu/lsm303-arduino/tree/master] as a base line and reduced it into my own version that only supports the accelerometer. I did this to get a better understanding of I^2SC
